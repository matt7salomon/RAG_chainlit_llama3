The prices in this dataset reflect the current status of the market. The LMP prices were\\ndownloaded for three separate nodes. Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) and ARIMA were selected\\nto predict the prices in the future from current values. These models perform well on time series\\ndata since they consider a window of time and roll the window over the data. 44 days of data were\\ndownloaded for each node since it was the maximum that OASIS allowed to download in one\\nsession. Arima allows for only one time series to be forecasted at a time so it doesn\\'t allow for\\nadditional features to be considered. To keep matters consistent and have similar comparison, the\\nsame time series were predicted using an RNN. Root mean squared error (RMSE) was considered\\nas the performance metric since we are comparing two time series together(i.e. the original data\\nand the predicted data).\\n\\n0-pl\\n\\nLocational Marginal Prices Prediction\\nMatt Salomon\\n'"
